                  The officiant will usually meet with the couple to discuss
                  their preferences for the ceremony and to get to know them as
                  individuals. They will also explain the legal requirements for
                  the ceremony. Based on the couple's preferences and cultural
                  or religious traditions, the officiant will create a ceremony
                  that reflects their personalities and values. They may provide
                  options for readings, prayers, or other elements to include in
                  the ceremony. The officiant will usually attend the wedding
                  rehearsal to ensure that everyone knows their role and that
                  the ceremony will run smoothly. On the wedding day, the
                  officiant will arrive early to ensure that everything is set
                  up correctly and to make any final preparations. They will
                  then lead the ceremony, which typically includes welcoming
                  guests, delivering a message or sermon, leading the vows and
                  ring exchange, and pronouncing the couple as married. After
                  the ceremony, the officiant will sign the marriage license
                  along with the couple and witnesses, making the marriage
                  legal.
